# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the project. This guide explains how to participate and what your contributions imply.

## How to contribute

### 1. Report bugs or suggest improvements

- Open an [issue](https://github.com/nicolasAguero99/DevGround-app/issues) describing the problem or idea.
- Use a clear title and, when applicable, labels (bug, feature, documentation, etc.).
- For bugs, include steps to reproduce and your environment (OS, app version).

### 2. Submit changes via Pull Requests (PRs)

1. **Fork** the repository and clone it locally.
2. Create a **branch** from `main` (e.g. `feature/description` or `fix/description`).
3. Make your **changes** and ensure the project still builds and, if applicable, tests pass.
4. **Commit** with clear, descriptive messages.
5. Open a **Pull Request** against the `main` branch of the upstream repository.
6. In the PR description, state what problem it solves or what feature it adds and how you tested it.

### 3. Review and approval

- All contributions go through **review**.
- Only maintainers can **approve** and merge PRs; there is no guarantee that every PR will be accepted.
- Change requests may be made (via PR comments). Reply and update the PR when ready.

### 4. Code of conduct and quality

- Keep a respectful tone in issues and PRs.
- Code should match the project’s style and structure; reviewers may request adjustments.

## License for your contributions

- Your contribution will be distributed under the **MIT License** that governs this project.
- The project owner may **relicense** the repository’s code (including your contribution) under the same or another compatible open source license, while preserving attribution as required by the MIT License.

This allows the project to maintain a single licensing and governance model in the long term.

## Summary

- Contribute via **issues** (reports, ideas) and **Pull Requests** (code, documentation).
- Every PR requires **review and approval** by a maintainer.
- By contributing code you accept its use under **MIT** and possible **relicensing** by the project.

If you have questions, open an issue and we’ll help.
